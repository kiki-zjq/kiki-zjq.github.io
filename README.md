# github-page-vue-demo

It is a Vue.js project.
And this is a personal homepage. The site is based on github-page.

website: https://kiki-zjq.github.io/#/

Because of github-page itself, loading of images and related project may be realatively slow when browsing online.

After `npm run dev` it will default load at localhost:8081

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8081
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report

# run unit tests
npm run unit

# run all tests
npm test
```
